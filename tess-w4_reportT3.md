## Abstract

This report contains the `FFT` (of the ARMA gap-filled TESS light curve) and 
powerspectra (from `SigSpec`).
For each star the comparison of both diagrams are displayed in a figure with 
two panels.


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
